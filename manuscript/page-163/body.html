When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.</p><p>In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.</p><p>"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl, "and if you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow morning."</p><p>She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.</p></div> </div>
