If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily."</p><p>"That is a first-rate idea," said the Lion. "One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw."</p><p>The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.</p></div> </div>
