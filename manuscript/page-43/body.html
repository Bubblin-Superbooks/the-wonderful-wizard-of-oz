Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.</p><p>When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, "You must be a great sorceress."</p><p>"Why?" asked the girl.</p><p>"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white."</p><p>"My dress is blue and white checked," said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.</p><p>"It is kind of you to wear that," said Boq. "Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly witch."</p></div> </div>
