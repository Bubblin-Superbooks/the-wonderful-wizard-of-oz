And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.</p><p>The Tin Woodman came to her and said:</p><p>"Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave me my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust."</p><p>"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully and wiped them away with the towel.</p></div> </div>
