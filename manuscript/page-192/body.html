<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.</p><p>"This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet them as they come."</p><p>He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.</p></div> </div>
