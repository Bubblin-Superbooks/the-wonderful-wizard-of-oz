But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:</p><p>"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage."</p><p>Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.
