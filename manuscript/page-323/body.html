<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more."</p><p>"What is your trouble?" asked the Lion quietly.</p><p>"We are all threatened," answered the tiger, "by a fierce enemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a tree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us."</p></div> </div>
